//  Rebecca Amarh-Adjei: Data Engineer Case Study:  Credit Card System
//Case Study Req-2.2.1   Data Extraction and Transportation with Sqoop 
//Utilize  Sqoop  to  extract  the  following  data  according  to  the specifications found in the mapping document: 
//1.   Branch data into CDW_SAPP_BRANCH 
//2.   Credit Card Data into CDW_SAPP_CREDITCARD 
//3.   Time data into CDW _SAPP_TIME 
//4.   Customer Data into CDW _SAPP_CUSTOMER 
// Notes: 
//-Data Engineers will be required to transform the data based  on  requirements  found  in  the  Mapping Document prior to loading the data into Hadoop. 
// -TIMEID is a field that the Data Engineers should create based on the DAY, MONTH, and TIME fields located in the  CUSTOMER  table.  Format  should  be  YYYYMMDD. For instance, January 4th, 2017 would become 20170104 
//-Data  Engineers  should  extract  the  above  data  to  the /Credit_Card_System/ folder in the Hadoop Filesystem
